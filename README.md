# SOFAR_ASSIGNMENT-4  GROUP-25

## Multi-floor navigation with ROS2, by using the Nav2 package.
### Developed by Koushikmani Maskalmatti Lakshman and Santhosh Sadhanandham under the guidance of professor Simone Macci√≤. 
The idea of this assignment is to construct in simulation a multi-floor environment,
where each floor has a different map layout. The robot knows a priori the individual
maps of each floor but needs some sort of state machine mechanism to dynamically
change the current loaded map for navigation upon entering another floor.

The software has been tested with the [TurtleBot3 Waffle](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/) robot model, which is a small, affordable and programmable, ROS-based mobile robot for use in education, research, hobby, and product prototyping. This robot can run SLAM algorithms to build a map of the environment and use it to localize itself while navigating

## Working
In this task robot will move starting from one floor to another floor to finishing its task.The proposed arrangement is basic and proficient and works impeccably. The arrangement comprises of a few situations when the robot needs to finish a specific order. The proposed arrangement functions as follows, at first the robot is put on the primary floor, and afterward moves to the human to pick something from him. After that robot moves to a unique lift zone. When the robot arrives at the unique zone and stays there for a while, the robot has a chance to move to another floor and dynamically changes the currently loaded map for navigation. It is essential to take note of that on each floor there is an exceptional development zone, arriving at which the robot has the potential chance to arrive at another floor. Hence, the main objective of the assignment, to change the map after entering another floor, was accomplished. 
## Installation Setup

- This package is developed with the ROS2 Humble and Nav2 package to install this follow the official documentation [Ros2](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html)

- OS Version:Ubuntu22.04

- [Rviz:](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) a visualization tool that allows inspect the simulation

- [Gazebo:](https://gazebosim.org/home) a 3-dimensional physics simulator used in robotics

- [Nav2:](https://navigation.ros.org/) an architecture built on top of the ROS2 environment which aims to find a safe way to drive a mobile robot from one point to  another point


 
## Packages to be installed(Nav2)  

       sudo apt install ros-humble-nav2* ros-humble-turtlebot3*
       
   Use this command for installing the packages needed for the assignment and clone the package from the [Main Package](https://github.com/Koushikmani/sofar.git) .After installing the packages needed build the package with the command.
